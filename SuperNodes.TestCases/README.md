# SuperNodes Test Cases

This is a supplementary test project that contains valid test cases, end-to-end tests, unit tests for generated code, and regression tests for SuperNodes.

> When fixing bugs in SuperNodes, be sure to replicate the bug first by creating a new test case. Then, fix the bug and verify that the test case passes. Be sure to include the additional test case in your pull request to prevent regressions in the future!

Unit tests are not included in this project — see `../SuperNodes.Tests/SuperNodes.Tests.csproj` for unit tests.
